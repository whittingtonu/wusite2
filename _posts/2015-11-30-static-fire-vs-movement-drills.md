#Static Fire vs Movement Drills

There is a friendly debate about what style of training is more advantageous to training a defensive shooter. One side will argue that practicing the fundamentals of marksmanship during static fire is the key to success. The other side will say that engaging targets while moving to, and utilizing cover is the only real test. At the Whittington U Defensive Academy there is an equilibrium of both static and movement drills. This blend of drills has been fine-tuned over the training seasons to bring out the best in both static fundamental shooting and movement in the use of cover drills. This combination delivers the best of both styles of learning to each and every student. 

##Static Firing

Static firing allows a shooter to focus, study, and practice on the core fundamentals of marksmanship while remaining stationary. Taking movement or use of cover out of the equation allows the person to hone their breathing, aiming, trigger press, and steady grip which are the core fundamentals of a defensive shooter. Static drills are also used to learn or test a new firearm. I always recommend a good regiment of static firing with a new handgun as well. It pays to take the time to learn the feel, function, and capabilities of a firearm before pushing into more difficult drills.

Static or stationary firing is also a solid way to warm up and refresh the muscle memory and quickly adjust any shooting errors. There are no magical distances or particular static drills that are the perfect workouts. Rather a variety of drills is the best approach. By adding variety it keeps you exposed to new challenges and minimizes the inevitable boredom that can come from shooting the same bullseye at the same distances over and over again. The key is to push and challenge yourself while maintaining your flawless fundamentals. 

##Movement Drills

Consider this, if static drills are the studying and practice of the proper fundamentals than moving and engaging targets while utilizing cover is the test of those mechanics. Being able to use your environment to your advantage is a critical thinking skillset. This skillset involves being able to recognize what angles, distances, and even objects can be used to gain an advantage over a threat. All of these decisions are made quickly and also while preparing yourself both physically and mentally for the potential to stop a threat with deadly force.

Movement drills are an incredible way to put all your skills together and these action scenarios are the favorite of nearly all our students at the Whittington U. The majority of the Whittington U critical learning moments happen during the movement and cover drills. I have personally witnessed amazing static shooters with flawless fundamentals and accuracy have difficulty successfully engaging targets during their first few movement drills. This is usually due to unforeseen factors, such as heavy breathing from quick movement. Sometimes it’s just the adrenaline rush and nervousness of being the only shooter while your classmates watch. No matter the difficulty, learning occurs, eyes are opened and everyone walks away wiser and better able to defend themselves and their loved ones.

>Fundamentals are not Basic, they are essential.  Our Level I Courses in the Precision Academy are designed to establish a strong Fundamental Foundation.  Consistency = Accuracy is our formula for success.  We have the highest physical effect over the movement of the muzzle behind the rifle and our inconsistencies compound with distance.  This is part three in a four part series on the Fundamentals of Precision Marksmanship.

##Fundamental:  Trigger Control:  the act of moving the trigger in a smooth and deliberate motion...

...as to not affect the projectile while it is still inside of the bore.  

This is the one Fundamental that I see the highest amount of error on from course to course.  When establishing a strong Fundamental Foundation, we focus on correct, repetitious action.  It is reliant on us to do the same thing each and every time; this is our *Consistency*.  Our goal is gaining the leverage over the movement of the muzzle.  

We want to control the muzzle to ensure consistent groups at distance and we can affect the projectile while it is still in the bore, if we are not smooth and deliberate with our trigger control.

##Location

Precision Shooting trigger control is much different than Defensive Engagements.  Time is really the key factor here: The worst thing that we can do is get in a hurry on the firing line.  When you come to one of our courses, you have nothing but time (as long as the weather behaves.)  Our goal is a holistic understanding; we want to give you the ability to understand the Fundamentals and employ the Techniques with the ability to apply them to any environment.  Leverage over the movement of the muzzle is the goal, regardless of the shooting platform and firing position.  

Location of the finger is important, but we do not dictate anything further than between the first knuckle to the tip of your dominant hand shooting finger.  The important thing is to not wrap over the trigger, on all firearms.  We want smooth and deliberate pressure, not a pulling action that will potentially move the muzzle (affecting the projectile.)  This is the concept that we will work to instill.  If you understand the concept, you can make it work best for you, the individual shooter.

##Integrated Act of Firing â€“ Follow Through

There is a process we establish when engaging a target:  Before, During and After the shot.  This process incorporates all four Fundamentals of Marksmanship: Breathing, Aiming, Steady Position and Trigger Control, but it is the Trigger Control that helps *Follow Through* to the next shot.
  
Smooth and deliberate pressure is the key and we advocate holding the trigger to the rear until all movement in the rifle stops, **and then count to two.**  Counting to two is our mind forcing the body to obey, otherwise we will not.  This is the error that I see in every course.  We spend the first day of all Level I Courses in the Precision Academy in the classroom, discussing Internal Ballistics, External Ballistics, Optical Adjustments and Marksmanship Techniques.  I point out that this is our most common error, not Following Through to the next shot.  Even when addressing this prior to engaging, it still occurs on the range.  It is a subconscious act, most students do not realize they are not controlling the trigger until it is presented to them.  This is why we advocate holding the trigger to the rear and *counting to two.* We have to make it a correct, conscious act.

##Fundamental: Trigger Control

Every Trigger operates off of friction and this is reflected in how heavy, or how much resistance it takes to release the firing pin.  Every firearm has an acclimation period, trigger control being a large portion of this acclimation.  The principle of smooth and deliberate pressure, holding the trigger to the rear *and counting to two* remains the same.  This allows us to correctly follow through to the next shot, resetting our Integrated Act of Firing to the next round in the Shooting Iteration.  Speed will come, as desired by the shooter only by consistency, fluidity and efficiency of motion.  We have to establish a correct foundation first, everything else can be developed from there.

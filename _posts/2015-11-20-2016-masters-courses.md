#2016 WU Masters Courses

2016 will usher in the first of the WU Masters Courses. We offer a progressive curriculum in all of our Defensive and Precision Academy Courses, with the overall intent of a holistic understanding of the firearm platform, environment around us and ourselves.

There are no such things as "basics," as it relates to consistency. We begin and end with Fundamentals. It does not matter if we are shooting at 5 or 1000 yards; we focus on developing a strong foundation to build on.

##WU Masters Courses  

Our Masters Courses are the "continuing education" in our University-style model. We will present a topic of focus for the Masters throughout 2016, which will give you an opportunity to put your understanding to the test.

>Our Masters Courses are open to all students who have completed:

Practical Pistol I-III
Practical Carbine I-II
Practical Shotgun I-II
Precision Long Range I-III
Extreme Long Range I-III

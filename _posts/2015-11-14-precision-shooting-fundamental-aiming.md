#Precision Shooting Fundamental Foundations:  Aiming
This is a four part series on the Fundamentals of Precision Long Range Marksmanship and why we focus on a strong Fundamental Foundation.  As Instructors, we diagnose Ammunition (if the student is shooting handloads,) Firing Position and Point of Aim.  Those three things have a gross effect on consistency in the target area.  We very rarely blame the firearm for poor performance unless it is display gross tendencies of inconsistency (note that term.)

##Fundamental #1:  Point of Aim

This is the relationship between the eye, optic and target.  Without magnified optics, we would not be able to engage the precise targets at the further distances with a high amount consistency, especially beyond 1000 yards.  At the WU Backcountry Training Area, we have the opportunity to engage to the limits of every single shoulder fired cartridge available on the market today.  Optics come with a variety of reticles, which are designed as measuring tools for the shooter.  The Duplex Reticle has no unit of measurement, Mil-Dot/Tactical Milling and MOA Reticle with units of measurement in MRADs and Minute of Angle.  Both MRAD and MOA are angular forms of measurement and can be related back to a Point of Aim/Point of Impact shift for the shooter.  The MRAD is associated with the metric system (m) and Minute of Angle with Imperial Units (yds).

Optics utilize an erector tube, housed inside the body of the optic.  The Elevation and Windage knobs will move that erector tube to reposition the muzzle of the rifle in accordance to the distance to the target and the flight of the projectile being shot.  The reticle can be housed in the first or second focal plane.   The first focal plane reticle is located between the erector lenses and the optic ocular assembly.  The image coming from the objective assembly is inverted, or upside down.  

The role of the erector lenses is to turn this image right side up.  The first focal plane will put the reticle to the front of these erector lenses (picture reversal assembly in the diagram.)  The size of the reticle will change in a variable scope, as one goes up and down in magnification.  The First Focal Plane reticle subtensions will also remain true to the units of measurement, meaning the reticle can be used to measure the sizes of targets at any magnification.  This is very helpful with range estimation formulas or measure Point of Impact adjustments at the target area.  The second focal plane reticle is located on the opposite side of the erector lenses, closer to the ocular assembly.  The size of the reticle will remain the same in variable scopes when moving up and down in magnification.  This means that the optic will need to be set on a certain magnification setting to read the units of measurement as true.

Eye Relief is the distance from the eye to the rear objective.  This distance is dependent on the magnification setting of the optic and the position in which the shooter is engaging.  The eye relief will vary from a seated position to the prone, just how the face physically sits on the stock.  Proper eye relief should have a full field of view with no black around the edges with the face comfortably set on the stock.  The shooter should not have to push their face forward or pull it back to achieve this full field of view.  Also, the shooter should take note on where their face is sitting vertically on the stock.  Most PLR Rifles will have an elevated base that the optic will sit on, causing the shooter to have to place their face higher on the stock vertically.  This can cause inconsistencies in Point of Aim because the shooter is uncomfortable and will not have as strong of a purchase with their Cheek/Stock weld with the lower jaw touching.  This is usually remedied with an adjustable cheek piece or something like a towel placed on the stock to give more elevation comfortable to the shooter.

When the eye relief is not correct, it causes a shadow in the viewing area.  This will cause a movement in the muzzle, vertically or horizontally, in the opposite direction of the shadow.  What is happening is the shooter is not looking through the optic in a straight line, even though it is perceived to be.  So, it is very important to have that full field of view to maintain a consistent sight picture.

##What Affects Point of Aim (and why we diagnose it…)

Every shooter sees things differently.  I get questions on the best optic, as far as clarity goes and this is difficult to answer.  Eyes are different, perception is different; I have seen high dollar optics match or exceed the mid-to lower range optics in clarity.  Perception is the key phrase here.  The same is for diagnosing Point of Impact variables as it relates to the Fundamental: Aiming.  The perception of the target changes from shooter to shooter.  Size, shape and color affect this.  Light Conditions greatly affect the perception of the target.  At the WU, most of our Precision Academy Ranges shoot East to West with the sun to our backs most of the day.  We utilize white as the color contrast and they are extremely bright in the morning, but as the day goes on, they stop shimmering and begin to blend in to the background.  Towards the end of the day, it becomes difficult to maintain the crosshairs in the same Point of Aim; the location of the sun affects the target that much.

Center of Mass, the center of the most mass of a target, is also the important piece in a consistent Point of Aim.  We do not hold over on targets as long as we have mechanical adjustments in our optics.  Our goal is a high amount of consistency at every distance engaged.  Again, we have opportunity to engage to the limits of every shoulder fired cartridge available.  Our targets are sized 1 – 4 MOA, depending on the distance, so we have a strong base to work off of to measure consistency.  So we retain a center of mass point of aim.  When we hold for winds, we retain this center of mass hold regardless.  If we deviate to match the Point of Impact, up or down, we lose the consistent Point of Aim.

Finally, the Cheek/Stock weld and the importance of keeping the face on the rifle until the shooting iteration is complete.  This is one of the more consistent errors I see in classes and the one that I look for the most.  Shooters have a tendency to remove the face from the stock to load, talk, write, and adjust.  This is not necessary, everything that needs to be done can be done while retaining a consistent Cheek/Stock weld.  Every time we remove our face from the stock, we change our Point of Aim and lose all consistency.

##Conclusion:

There is nothing basic in the shooting disciplines, especially Precision Long Range Shooting.  Consistency equals Accuracy; this is our formula for success.  The shooter has the highest effect of inconsistency on the projectile.  It is up to us to create a level of consistency in an Integrated Act of Firing.  It is the Fundamentals that we will rely on for this and establishing the correct fundamental is the key to success.

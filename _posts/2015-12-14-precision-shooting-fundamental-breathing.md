#Precision Shooting Fundamental Foundations:  Breathing

>In our four part Fundamental Foundation Series, we are emphasizing the gaining of leverage over the movement of the muzzle by building a strong Fundamental Foundation.  Consistency Equals Accuracy is our formula for success; we will strive to achieve the same thing each and every time behind the rifle.  There are no “basics” in precision shooting; there are Fundamentals.

#Fundamental Foundation:  Breathing

Correct breathing is important in everything that we do.  Breathing enables the majority of our body functions.  If we do not breathe, we die.  If we breathe too much, too quickly, we pass out.  Finding the correct cycle of breathing to fit the amount of oxygen needed for a situation is vital for success.  Precision Shooting requires consistency, it requires that we do the same thing each and every time.  We physically have the largest effect on the movement of the muzzle: before, during and after the shot.  It is critical for us to create a cycle, an Integrated Act of Firing that incorporates Breathing as a pillar in the foundation.

##Body’s Natural Pause

Comfort and relaxation are key components to success in Precision Shooting.  If we are not comfortable, we are fighting the rifle and more specifically, the muzzle.  Breathing is a natural part of our body’s circulation, and necessary.  The goal is to incorporate our Integrated Act of Firing into our natural rhythm.  This means utilizing the Body’s Natural Pause.

Our Natural Pause is the point in our breathing cycle where we are in the exhale portion or down-breath and our body is naturally at rest.  We want to avoid holding our breath when firing, as this is a muscular constriction holding the air in our lungs, but we also, we want to remain comfortable during our pause.  Every human body is different but the concept remains the same:  utilize your Natural Pause, do not hold the air in your lungs.   Just do so to your individual capacity.

##Breathing and Alternate Firing Positions

Breathing will affect the muzzle in a number of directions, depending on the firing position, but this is also in conjunction with the other Fundamentals.  The Fundamental: Steady Position is very important and we utilize the prone position for the majority of our PLR I-III Courses because it is the most stable.  We also create a shooting platform that promotes stability and leverage over the movement of the muzzle.

Breathing is a core piece of this but does not have as much effect until we start to get higher up off of the ground, and this is only if we are utilizing our Steady Position correctly to begin with.  PLR II gives us a very brief familiarization to the Alternate Firing Positions: Kneeling and Standing.  We take roughly 10 rounds in each position on the High Angle Range to demonstrate the necessary shift in focus to compensate for the loss of stability - especially when moving from our very stable prone position.  The “little” things have a much higher effect on the shooting platform now and this forces us to change to gain leverage over the movement of the muzzle.  

This is a combination of all four Fundamentals, but we see Breathing playing a much larger role outside of the Prone Supported Position.  When you are in our PLR II and experiencing the stability effect during our AFP Familiarization Fire, you will understand why we devote topics in our Masters Courses to Alternate Firing Positions.

##Conclusion

The Fundamental: Breathing provides rhythm and control to the Integrated Act of Firing, along with ability and comfort to the firing position.  There is no such thing as “basics” in Precision Shooting.  The things that cause the most inconsistencies down at the target area are generally caused by an inconsistent shooter.  Breathing is a fundamental for a reason.  It is up to us to demonstrate self-discipline and incorporate consistent Breathing into our Integrated Act of Firing until it is becomes natural.

The Whittington U is the instructional division of the NRA Whittington Center that utilizes an educational model in the approach to firearms instruction. Broken down into Academies that are applicable to the firearm or method of instruction, the Whittington U strives to assist all students in building both confidence and a fundamental understanding of all the firearm platforms.<br><br>The Whittington U also focuses on the real world implementation of the firearm platform, regardless if it is a technical, precision long range or defensive oriented curriculum. Each course is designed to educate students in a manner that is both easily understandable and retainable. Our course sizes are no larger than 10 students per class with a student/instructor ratio of 4:1 to ensure strong one-on-one interaction.

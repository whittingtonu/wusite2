Whittington U has some of the most unique training areas of any of the firearm training facilities worldwide. Designed around a progressive curriculum, each with specific training goals in mind, the WU Backcountry Training Area is combines reactive steel targets with beautiful and challenging terrain.  

Each range plays a specific role in Level I-III and the upcoming Master's Courses.

## WU Known Distance Range

Located up in Van Houten Canyon, the WU KD Range offers targets ranging from 400 to 1950 yards. The KD Range is used in all levels of the School of 1000 Yards and School of Extreme Long Range, exclusively in the Level I Courses.

This range is purposed in the establishment a strong fundamental foundation, refresher going into the Level II and Level III Courses, along with the first steps in understanding the Range Estimation Formulas in PLR/ELR III.

## WU High Angle Range

Precision Academy Level II Courses incorporate Angles and an introduction in Alternate Firing Positions into the curriculum path. The High Angle Range, located in Willow Canyon, is the second range in the Backcountry Training Area with three firing points to engage targets from 300 to 2870 yards!

*Firing Point 1* offers steel targets of varying sizes and locations.  Shooting over three ridge lines from FP1 offers a very challenging opportunity for learning how the wind affects the projectile at varying distances.  The angles incorporated are great learning points into understanding why we have to adjust our optics elevation.

*Firing Point 2* gives a different perspective on the target area and is the final firing point for the School of 1000 Yards.  Each class ends with a friendly competition at a target situated at 1600 yards.  It is amazing how consistent the groups are at that range!

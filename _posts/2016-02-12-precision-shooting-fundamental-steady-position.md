>Fundamentals are not Basic, they are essential.  Our Level I Courses in the Precision Academy are designed to establish a strong Fundamental Foundation.  Consistency = Accuracy is our formula for success.  We have the highest physical effect over the movement of the muzzle behind the rifle and our inconsistencies compound with distance.  This is part three in a four part series on the Fundamentals of Precision Marksmanship.

## Fundamental:  Steady Position:  a consistent physical interaction between the body and the firearm...

All Whittington U Courses strive to implement a holistic understanding of the information taught; a well rounded understanding of the firearm/equipment, environment and ourselves.  Steady Position is the fundamental that we work most intently with during our Level I Courses at the Whittington U Precision Academy, because of the overall physical effect on the muzzle.  When inconsistency at the target area begins to develop, our Instructors diagnose three things:  Ammunition, Point of Aim and Steady Position.  Very rarely is it the rifle that is causing the issue. Nine times out of ten in our Level I Courses, the position is the culprit for inconsistency at the target area.

# Rifle Platform

Let’s begin with the rifle platform.  I have seen just about every major manufacturer rifle come through our courses, from both bolt action and semi-automatic.  The same is said for the commercial ammunition that is shot through them.  Ultimately, we are looking for consistent pressure that will yield consistent velocity, yielding consistent shot groups at the target.  We see more custom rifles than commercial, but we have at least several of each, commercial and custom, in every class.  So I see these platforms operating side by side with each other on a continual basis. 
 
In the Rifle Platform itself, we are looking for Chamber dimensions that are consistent with the expansion of the ammunition cartridge being shot, with the Throat/Leade area that are supporting the projectile sized correctly.  We want the rifling to be consistent in how it is imparted into the barrel, whether cut, button or hammer forged, all with the intention of keeping the pressures pushing the projectile consistent from shot to shot.  Again, unless we get something in a class that is in a very specific condition, (like my dad’s old .30-06 that has been sitting in the gun case for years), it is very rarely the rifle that causes the inconsistencies at the target area.

# Position

Consistency in our physical contact with the rifle is extremely important.  Our goal is to efficiently and effectively gain the leverage over the movement of the muzzle.  We should be able to:

1.  Get into our position quickly and with as little movement as possible.
2.  Retain a consistent sight picture regardless of the size and distance to the target.
3.  Keep the target in our sight picture through the entire shot process (and consistently see the impact of our round).
4.  Follow through to the next shot with little movement to the muzzle.  

Our position should be comfortable but also flexible, in the event things change in the target area.  

## Principles of Stability

All of our courses are designed around both a technical and practical application of the information taught.  This means that you can use the information to progress your understanding and experience for target shooting, competition and hunting.  We teach Principles in all Whittington U Courses.  This gives us the flexibility to interact with a number of environments while still retaining a high level of Consistency.  

Consistency=Accuracy is our formula for success.  It is up to us to be both stable and comfortable behind the rifle at all times. If we are not comfortable, we are not stable and fight the rifle.  The same is said about not being stable and comfortable, they go hand in hand. 
   
### Control Point #1:

Control Point #1 is the support on the front side of the rifle.  There are options for this: monopod and tripod (if shooting from a position outside of the prone, like kneeling or standing) bipod and a rest for the stock itself.  Each method carries its own pros and cons that require us to focus on different points during the firing process to maintain leverage over the movement of the muzzle.  We do a familiarization fire in our PLR II Courses that utilize a tripod/front rest for kneeling and standing positions, but it is very truncated as far as the instruction goes.  We focus on Alternate Firing Positions in our Masters Courses, held later in 2016.

#### Bi-pod and Front Rest Method

We desire a position that can be utilized for a variety of equipment and cartridges.  Since we see just about every rifle manufacturer, cartridge and accessory at the Whittington U, our curriculum revolves around the most consistent position options to enhance the physical interact with a variety of firearms.  We want to instill an understanding of the physics behind what is causing excesive movement of the platform and how it affects the muzzle.  This is part of our holistic approach.  Understand this and you can apply leverage regardless of the firing position.

We begin our courses in the prone position, on our stomach as in-line with the rifle as comfortably possible.  Our goal is to keep the target in our sight picture, so we can spot the impact and make the timely adjustments for wind.  We focus on a linear path of hips to shoulder to rifle when getting into our position.  This will help with increasing true, straight-lined movement of the rifle during the recoil phase.  If we approach the rifle at an angle, our body angled off to the left for example, the muzzle will have a tendency to drift to the right during the recoil and we will lose our target in the sight picture.  

#### We advocate a Front Rest over a Bi-Pod in our courses for two main reasons:

1.  The bipod creates a hinge point on the front of the rifle.

The bi-pod is attached generally at or around the front sling swivel.  Depending on the manufacturer of the bi-pod, there will be a certain amount of movement, hinging at this point in the rifle.  When training with the bi-pod, one must “load” or put weight forward into the bi-pod legs.  Regardless of how much a person weighs, the rifle will move to the rear and it is this movement that will cause inconsistencies with the muzzle.  This is the initial take off point for that projectile and we lose consistency from the very beginning.

2.	The bi-pod has a higher tendency to jump to the left or right.

The direction will depend on which side is dominant with the body; the muzzle will drift opposite the dominant side.  We strive to maintain as much control over the movement of the rifle and when loading the bi-pods, we put pressure forward.  If we are doing this properly, we will reduce the rearward movement of the rifle.  However, if we are shooting a higher pressure cartridge, the muzzle has the potential to act like a firehose and will jump to the left/right.  

![Control Point 1]({{ site.url }}/images/articles/Foundations/cp1.jpg)

We utilize the Front Rest Method, much like benchrest shooting but with what a practical shooter could/would have with them in the field:  A pack being one of those items.  The pack has a larger amount of mass that will envelope the front portion of the stock, as opposed to a single attaching point that the bipod legs provide.  The pack will also assist in a more consistent linear rearward path for the muzzle during recoil, helping cut down on the “jump” to the left/right movement.  This position enhances a consistent sight picture and a higher amount of control over the movement of the muzzle.

We see on a very consistent basis, sub-MOA groups at the extreme limits of the cartridges in courses.  The position helps greatly, but it boils down to an overall individual understanding of the mechanics involved in controlling the movement of the muzzle.  I have taught the Bi-Pod Method for many years and it has caused me, as an Instructor, to work harder.  The Bi-Pod is fast to employ and can be used on every rifle platform, but it does not always translate well from cartridge to cartridge.  The lesser recoiling cartridges are easier to control vs. the magnums.  We see at least one .300WM per course.

**3 round group on sight in during PLR I, June 12-14, 2015**

The overall goal is Consistency in grouping at the target area and we see much more consistent results with the Front Rest over the Bi-Pod. *Note:* If you want to train specifically with your bi-pod, you are more than welcome to.  The Front Rest Method is our preferred because of the consistent results achieved.
 
#### Control Point #2

This is the point where the Rifle physically interacts with the shooter at the shoulder.  In our PLR/ELR I-III Courses, we utilize an enhanced rear bag as an “assist” in controlling the rearward movement of the rifle.  This is extremely effective in keeping the target in the sight picture during recoil.  This helps with establishing a consistent Natural Point of Aim, where the rifle is naturally at rest in relation to the shooter and the target.  It also allows us to shoot more rounds in class.  We ask for 200 rounds per could; we see on average 120-160 rounds per course shot.  

This is generally more than what most recreational Precision Rifle shooters are used to shooting in a 3-day period, especially when we get into the magnum cartridges.  The enhanced rear bag helps to instill an understanding of how the muzzle moves during recoil and how much we physically affect the muzzle.  If we start to see rounds going high over the target, then it is generally excessive movement at the shoulder (Control Point #2.)  When we allow the rifle to move rearward in our position, the result is the muzzle rising, causing the projectile to strike higher.  The opposite will happen when we begin to anticipate the movement of the rifle and “brace” our bodies forward, pushing the muzzle down.  The projectile will impact low.  

![Control Point 2]({{ site.url }}/images/articles/Foundations/cp2.jpg)

The enhanced rear bag assists in controlling the movement of the muzzle by giving more mass to the shooter without losing physical control over the stock.  This is the key point to the utilizing this position, we are the ones driving the rifle.  The rear bag is there to assist us in gaining leverage in the position during recoil and helping to increase the amount of rounds possible to shoot in a 3 day period.  Our non-dominant hand will wrap around to the rear of the stock, controlling both the rear bag and the rifle simultaneously.  This allows us to keep the rifle tied into our bodies and move left/right, up/down as a unit: Rifle and Body together.  

The face stays on the stock in our Cheek/Stock weld and we employ the Principles of Stability in gaining the rifle’s Natural Point of Aim.  We will then go through our checklists, leading into the Integrated Act of Firing, employing all the fundamentals simultaneously and then following-through to the next shot.

# Conclusion

This is the final installment in our Fundamental Foundations series for our WU Precision Academy Courses.  There are no basics in shooting, just Fundamentals of Consistent Physical Interaction with the firearm.  Our goal is to instill a holistic understanding of the rifle/equipment, environment and ourselves.  You will then be able to take this information and apply it to everything that you do in the future.  An understanding of mechanics and leverage over the movement of the muzzle will allow you to employ your rifle in any environment, under any condition.
